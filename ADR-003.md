# ADR-001: Declarative AI System Definitions using Kubernetes-style Schemas with Runtime Independence

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2025-09-01

## 1. Context

The process of building, deploying, and managing AI systems, particularly those involving Large Language Models (LLMs), is fragmented and complex. Key components like prompts, model configurations, tool integrations, knowledge bases (RAG), and security policies are often spread across application code, environment variables, and separate configuration files.

This imperative, code-first approach leads to several significant problems:

*   **Lack of Standardization:** Every AI "agent" is a bespoke creation, making them difficult to understand, reuse, or manage consistently.
*   **Poor Governance and Auditing:** It is extremely difficult to audit an agent's capabilities or security posture when its definition is embedded within code.
*   **Configuration Drift:** The configuration running in production can easily drift from what is defined in source control, leading to unpredictable behavior.
*   **Operational Complexity:** Scaling, updating, and ensuring reliability requires custom tooling and significant operational overhead for each new project.
*   **Barriers to Collaboration:** Prompt engineers, data scientists, application developers, and platform engineers lack a common language or contract, slowing down development cycles.
*   **GitOps Incompatibility:** The imperative nature of defining agents in code makes it nearly impossible to adopt modern GitOps practices for managing the AI system's lifecycle.

We need a standardized, auditable, and scalable framework that treats the definition of an AI system as a first-class, version-controlled asset.

## 2. Decision

We will adopt a **declarative-first approach using Kubernetes-style YAML schemas** as the canonical source of truth for defining our AI systems.

This decision **decouples the specification schema from the runtime implementation**. The schema acts as a formal contract, while the execution environment can be chosen to best fit the use case.

The canonical definitions for our AI systems will be modeled in three core schemas:

1.  **`Agent`**: A schema that declaratively defines a single AI agent, including its identity, role, goal, system prompt, LLM configuration, bound tools, knowledge base connections, and security guardrails.
2.  **`KnowledgeBase`**: A schema that defines a data source for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), including the data connection, ingestion pipeline, indexing strategy, and data security policies (e.g., PHI redaction).
3.  **`AgentWorkflow`**: A schema that orchestrates multiple `Agents` to accomplish a complex task, defining the participants and the topology of their interactions.

The "intent" of an AI system is captured in these YAML specifications. The "execution" can be achieved through multiple, non-exclusive pathways:

*   **A. Runtime Interpretation:** A generic runtime environment (e.g., a serverless function, a containerized application) is designed to bootstrap itself by reading a given specification YAML at startup. Frameworks like Agno or Mastra could implement this pattern, allowing the same runtime binary to behave as any agent simply by being provided a different spec file.
*   **B. Build-Time Transpilation (Code Generation):** A CI/CD pipeline step takes a specification YAML as input and transpiles it into framework-specific source code or configuration (e.g., generating Python code that uses the LangChain SDK).
*   **C. Kubernetes-Native Reconciliation:** For environments that are already Kubernetes-native, the schemas can be implemented as true Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), and a Kubernetes operator can perform a reconciliation loop to manage the AI system's lifecycle directly. This becomes *one of the possible runtimes*, not the only one.

This approach allows teams to choose the best runtime for their specific use case while still adhering to a single, unified standard for defining their AI systems.

## 3. Consequences

### Positive

*   **Configuration-as-Code and GitOps:** The entire definition of an AI system is captured in version-controlled YAML. This provides a complete audit trail and enables automated, auditable deployments.
*   **Runtime Flexibility:** Teams are not locked into a single platform. AI systems can be deployed to Kubernetes, serverless platforms, edge devices, or run locally, all from the same declarative source of truth.
*   **Standardization and Governance:** The schemas provide a common language and a clear contract for AI systems across the organization, enabling consistent security and governance checks regardless of the deployment target.
*   **Reduced Barrier to Entry:** Teams can start building and deploying agents in a simple serverless environment without needing to become Kubernetes experts, drastically lowering the operational overhead.
*   **Improved Developer Experience:** A developer can write an `Agent` spec and test it immediately using a lightweight local runtime that interprets the YAML, ensuring high fidelity between development and production.
*   **Strong Decoupling of Concerns:** The specification acts as a clean contract. Platform teams can offer a menu of certified runtimes, while product teams can focus solely on defining the agent's behavior in YAML.

### Negative

*   **Engineering Effort for Runtimes:** Instead of building one complex system, we must now build and maintain multiple runtimes and/or transpilers. Ensuring these different runtimes have feature parity is a significant engineering challenge.
*   **Risk of Implementation Inconsistency:** Different runtimes might interpret ambiguous parts of the specification differently. A robust conformance testing suite becomes critical to certify that a given runtime fully adheres to the spec.
*   **Increased Schema Governance Overhead:** Since the schema is the central contract for multiple runtimes, changes to it must be managed with extreme care. A breaking change could require coordinated updates across several runtime projects.
*   **"YAML Engineering" Overhead:** For very simple use cases, defining a full-fledged specification manifest can feel more verbose than writing a short, imperative script.

## 4. Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Imperative SDKs / Libraries (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex)
*   **Description:** Provide developers with a library to define and run agents imperatively within their application code.
*   **Why Rejected:** This approach directly leads to the problems outlined in the **Context** section. It tightly couples configuration with code, lacks standardization, is difficult to govern, and is incompatible with GitOps. Each agent becomes an opaque "black box" from a platform perspective.

### Alternative 2: Centralized UI-Driven / Database-Backed Platform
*   **Description:** A web-based platform where users create agents by filling out forms, with configurations stored in a proprietary database.
*   **Why Rejected:** This is antithetical to our "as-code" and GitOps principles. It creates a "click-ops" culture, making versioning, auditing, and CI/CD extremely difficult and creating a central bottleneck.

### Alternative 3: The Pure Kubernetes Operator Model (The initial proposal)
*   **Description:** All specifications are implemented as true Kubernetes CRDs, managed exclusively by operators. This would be our only supported runtime.
*   **Why Rejected as the Sole Approach:** While powerful, this model was deemed too rigid. It would force all AI development onto Kubernetes, imposing a steep learning curve and high operational cost on all teams. Our final decision incorporates this model as **one of several valid runtime options**, not the mandatory one, thereby providing an "on-ramp" for teams with varying levels of operational maturity.
