## 💥 Impact Analysis

<!--
This is a critical section for a repository managing specifications. Please think carefully about the impact of your changes.
-->

#### Is this a breaking change?
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

<!-- If yes, please describe the impact and the migration path for existing users. -->

#### How will this change affect existing Agents, Workflows, or KnowledgeBases?
<!-- e.g., "Existing workflows without `loopConfig` will continue to function as before. No migration is needed." -->
<!-- e.g., "This deprecates the `oldField` in favor of `newField`. We will support both for two minor versions." -->

#### Are there any new security considerations?
<!-- e.g., "The new `customScript` field in the spec could introduce a remote code execution risk if not properly sanitized by the runtime." -->

#### Does this change require updates to the runtime environment or related tooling?
<!-- e.g., "Yes, the agent runtime will need to be updated to recognize and handle the new `Aggregate` mode in workflows." -->
