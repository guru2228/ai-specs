# ADR-001: Declarative, Kubernetes-Native Approach for AI System Definitions

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2025-08-31

## Context

The process of building, deploying, and managing AI systems, particularly those involving Large Language Models (LLMs), is fragmented and complex. Key components like prompts, model configurations, tool integrations (functions), knowledge bases (RAG), and security policies are often spread across application code, environment variables, and separate configuration files.

This approach leads to several significant problems:
*   **Lack of Standardization:** Every AI application or "agent" is a bespoke creation, making them difficult to understand, reuse, or manage consistently.
*   **Poor Governance and Auditing:** It is extremely difficult to audit an agent's capabilities, security posture, or data handling policies when its definition is embedded within imperative code. Changes are not centrally visible.
*   **Configuration Drift:** The configuration running in production can easily drift from what is defined in source control, leading to unpredictable behavior.
*   **Operational Complexity:** Scaling, updating, and ensuring the reliability of these systems requires custom tooling and significant operational overhead for each new project.
*   **Barriers to Collaboration:** Prompt engineers, data scientists, application developers, and platform engineers lack a common language or contract to define the components of an AI system, slowing down development cycles.
*   **GitOps Incompatibility:** The imperative nature of defining agents in code makes it nearly impossible to adopt modern GitOps practices for managing the AI system's lifecycle.

We need a standardized, auditable, and scalable framework that treats the definition of an AI system as a first-class, version-controlled asset.

## Decision

We will adopt a **declarative, Kubernetes-native approach** for defining and managing all aspects of our AI systems.

This will be implemented by creating a set of **Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** that model the core components of an AI ecosystem. The primary CRDs will be:

1.  **`Agent`**: A CRD that declaratively defines a single AI agent. This includes its identity, role, goal, system prompt, LLM configuration, bound tools, knowledge base connections, and security guardrails.
2.  **`KnowledgeBase`**: A CRD that defines a data source for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This includes the data connection, ingestion pipeline (content extraction, chunking, embedding), indexing strategy, and data security policies (e.g., PHI redaction).
3.  **`AgentWorkflow`**: A CRD that orchestrates multiple `Agents` to accomplish a complex task. It defines the participants, the topology of their interactions (e.g., sequential, parallel, network), and the flow of data between them.

Engineers will define the **desired state** of their AI system in YAML manifests. A set of Kubernetes operators (the "runtime environment") will be responsible for a continuous reconciliation loop, ensuring the deployed system always matches the state defined in the manifest.

## Consequences

### Positive
*   **Configuration-as-Code and GitOps:** The entire definition of an AI system—from its core prompt to its security policies—is captured in version-controlled YAML. Changes can be proposed via pull requests, reviewed, and automatically deployed using GitOps tools like ArgoCD or Flux. This provides a complete audit trail.
*   **Standardization and Reusability:** The CRDs establish a common, organization-wide schema for what constitutes an `Agent` or a `KnowledgeBase`. This promotes component reuse and makes different AI systems easier to understand and integrate.
*   **Enhanced Security and Governance:** Security policies, guardrails, data classification, and compliance settings (e.g., HIPAA) are now explicit, auditable fields within the specification. This allows for policy enforcement at the platform level and makes security posture reviews straightforward.
*   **Decoupling of Concerns:** The CRDs act as a contract between teams.
    *   **Prompt Engineers** can iterate on prompts and personas in YAML without touching application code.
    *   **Platform Engineers** can focus on building a robust, secure runtime (the operators) that serves any compliant `Agent`.
    *   **Application Developers** can interact with agents via a stable API without needing to know their internal composition.
*   **Native Kubernetes Lifecycle Management:** We inherit the power of the Kubernetes control plane. Our AI systems become self-healing, scalable (e.g., via Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), and benefit from standardized rolling updates.
*   **Discoverability and Introspection:** The Kubernetes API becomes a central, live registry of all AI assets. One can instantly discover all agents in a cluster with `kubectl get agents` and inspect their full configuration with `kubectl describe agent <name>`.
*   **Ecosystem Integration:** This approach seamlessly integrates with the vast cloud-native ecosystem for monitoring (Prometheus), logging (Fluentd), tracing (OpenTelemetry), and policy enforcement (OPA/Gatekeeper).

### Negative
*   **Increased Upfront Complexity:** This approach requires a significant upfront investment in designing the CRDs and developing the corresponding Kubernetes operators. This is a complex software project in itself.
*   **Tight Coupling to Kubernetes:** Our entire AI framework becomes dependent on the Kubernetes ecosystem. Teams or projects not running on Kubernetes will be unable to leverage this framework without significant adaptation.
*   **Steeper Learning Curve:** Engineers must now be familiar not only with AI concepts but also with Kubernetes principles, including CRDs, YAML manifests, and operator patterns.
*   **"YAML Engineering" Overhead:** For very simple use cases, defining a full-fledged CRD manifest can feel more verbose and heavyweight than writing a short, imperative script. There is a risk of overly complex YAML files.
*   **Runtime Bottleneck:** The central operators that manage the reconciliation loops become a critical piece of infrastructure that must be highly available, scalable, and secure.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Imperative SDKs / Libraries (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex)
*   **Description:** Provide developers with a library (e.g., in Python or Go) to define and run agents imperatively within their application code.
*   **Pros:** Familiar to developers, highly flexible, excellent for rapid prototyping and research.
*   **Cons (Why Rejected):** This approach directly leads to the problems outlined in the **Context** section. It tightly couples configuration with code, lacks standardization, is difficult to govern, and is incompatible with GitOps. Each agent becomes an opaque "black box" from a platform perspective.

### 2. Centralized UI-Driven / Database-Backed Platform
*   **Description:** A web-based platform where users create agents by filling out forms. The configurations are stored in a central proprietary database.
*   **Pros:** Can be very user-friendly for non-technical users. Provides a single point of control.
*   **Cons (Why Rejected):** This is antithetical to the "as-code" philosophy. It creates a "click-ops" culture, making versioning, auditing, and CI/CD extremely difficult. It also introduces a central bottleneck and single point of failure. It is less flexible and harder to integrate with external tools compared to an API-first approach.

### 3. Simple Configuration Files (e.g., TOML, JSON) with a Custom Daemon
*   **Description:** Agents are defined in a simple config format like `.toml`, and a custom-built daemon service reads these files to run the agents.
*   **Pros:** Simpler than creating Kubernetes CRDs and operators. Less dependency on the Kubernetes ecosystem.
*   **Cons (Why Rejected):** This approach requires us to reinvent a significant portion of the Kubernetes control plane. We would need to build our own mechanisms for lifecycle management, health checking, scaling, service discovery, and providing a robust API. Kubernetes provides a battle-tested, industry-standard foundation for these capabilities, and building our own would be a massive, duplicative effort. By using CRDs, we extend a powerful existing system instead of building a weaker one from scratch.
