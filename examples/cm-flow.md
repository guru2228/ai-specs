I've created six comprehensive Clinical Care Management workflow samples demonstrating different orchestration modes:

## 1. **Patient Admission and Care Planning (Sequential Mode)**
- Step-by-step admission process from intake through discharge planning
- Ensures regulatory compliance with 24-hour assessment requirements
- Each step depends on successful completion of the previous one
- Includes error handling with retry strategies for critical steps

## 2. **Complex Care Coordination (Network Mode)**
- Manages patients with multiple chronic conditions
- Uses dependency graphs for complex routing between specialists
- Conditional execution based on patient conditions and risk scores
- Demonstrates how multiple agents work together with interdependencies

## 3. **Emergency Department Triage (Parallel Mode)**
- Enables simultaneous assessment and diagnostic activities
- Reduces door-to-treatment time through parallel processing
- All steps execute independently and concurrently
- Optimized for rapid emergency response

## 4. **Chronic Disease Monitoring (Loop Mode)**
- Continuous monitoring with iterative assessment cycles
- Implements feedback loops for intervention optimization
- Maximum iteration controls prevent infinite loops
- Escalation pathways based on risk thresholds

## 5. **Multi-Disciplinary Team Review (Aggregate Mode)**
- Multiple specialists provide independent assessments
- Synthesis step waits for ALL specialist inputs before proceeding
- Consensus building from diverse clinical perspectives
- Used for complex cases requiring team-based decisions

## 6. **Post-Discharge Follow-up (Hierarchical Mode)**
- Tiered intervention approach based on risk stratification
- Inline orchestrator with detailed hierarchical logic
- Automatic escalation between intervention tiers
- Comprehensive readmission prevention strategy

Each workflow demonstrates:
- **Complete identity and versioning** for tracking and governance
- **Different orchestration patterns** appropriate to clinical scenarios
- **Robust error handling** with retry strategies and fallbacks
- **Security and compliance** features for PHI protection
- **Comprehensive telemetry** for workflow monitoring
- **Both inline and participant-based orchestrators**
- **A2A and Local protocol options** for agent communication
- **Conditional execution** based on clinical criteria
- **State management** for long-running workflows

These workflows show how complex clinical processes can be automated while maintaining quality, safety, and regulatory compliance standards in healthcare settings.
