I've created two comprehensive healthcare agent configuration samples based on the provided specification:

## 1. **Clinical Care Coordinator Agent**
This agent focuses on comprehensive patient care management with capabilities including:
- **Care Plan Management**: Creating and maintaining individualized care plans
- **Patient Monitoring**: Tracking vitals, lab results, and care adherence
- **Provider Coordination**: Facilitating communication between care teams
- **Integration Points**: EHR systems, scheduling platforms, clinical guidelines
- **Knowledge Bases**: Clinical guidelines and drug interaction databases
- **Security**: Full HIPAA compliance with PHI data classification

## 2. **Utilization Management Specialist Agent**
This agent handles authorization and medical necessity reviews with features for:
- **Prior Authorization Processing**: Reviewing requests against clinical criteria
- **Clinical Criteria Application**: Using InterQual, MCG, and custom guidelines
- **Provider Collaboration**: Supporting peer-to-peer reviews and appeals
- **Integration Systems**: UM authorization system, clinical criteria servers, claims data
- **Knowledge Bases**: Medical policies, clinical criteria, provider contracts
- **Compliance**: NCQA, URAC, and CMS regulatory requirements

Both agents demonstrate:
- **Complete identity and versioning** with Git tracking
- **Comprehensive security controls** including RBAC, data policies, and egress controls
- **Production-ready configurations** with appropriate resource allocations
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) capabilities** for inter-agent communication
- **RAG implementation** for knowledge retrieval with semantic search
- **Extensive telemetry and monitoring** for operational visibility
- **Proper secret management** using Azure Key Vault
- **Multiple authentication methods** (OAuth2.1, API Keys, Managed Identity)

These configurations showcase how AI agents can be deployed in healthcare settings while maintaining strict compliance, security, and operational excellence standards. The agents can work together through the A2A protocol, allowing the Care Coordinator to request authorization support from the Utilization Management agent when needed.
